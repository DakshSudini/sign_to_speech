# sign_to_speech
Today I made an AI that converts sign language to speech. I trained it from scratch using a dataset from Kaggle and with the help of chatgpt. Overall the model worked decently however as I had to run it on my laptop I decided not to train it on the letters that require you to move your fingers as that would be more computationally demanding. The model was working good however as I am still very bad in American Sign Language(ASL) it was difficult for me to make the required signs to test out all the alphabets. I think I could improve the model further but that would require more training data and would be more computationally demanding so I settled on this
